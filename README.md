# zeton_react

Zeton is an application that support behavioral therapy.
Token system for the child.
Allows you to earn points for your activities and exchange them for prizes.

## Application goals

- Developing deficit (desirable) behaviour
- Reduction of undesired behaviour
- Generating and maintaining therapy effects over time

## Development setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup node environment

To install dependencies, run:

### `npm install`

## Available Scripts

To list every command, run: `npm run`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

or if You have error try:
  ### `npm run start4legacy`


Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

or if You have error try:
### `npm run build4legacy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Project UI

For styling we use [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

Install the package of styled-components in your project directory with:

`npm install --save styled-components`

---

## Store container

For keeping state we use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

<!-- Install Redux Toolkit in your project directory with:

`npm install @reduxjs/toolkit` -->

Next install Redux core library:

`npm install redux`

And..

`npm install react-redux`

---

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
